    </p>
    <ul>Ingredients
        <li>10 to 12 ounces ribeye steak</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1/2 medium sweet onion, sliced</li>
        <li>1/2 green bell pepper, sliced</li>
        <li>1/2 red bell pepper, sliced</li>
        <li>2 ounces (3 slices) provolone cheese</li>
        <li>2 hoagie rolls, toasted</li>
        <li>Fresh thyme, for garnish, optional</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>Steps
        <li>Freeze and slice the steak:
            Place steak in freezer on a sheet pan and into the freezer
            so it gets cold but not stiff. Then while its cold trim off
            any large pieces of fat and cut the steak into thin slices.
            Cut the pieces as thin as possible, think of thin cut deli meat.
            Season the steak with salt and pepper.
        </li>
        <li>Cook the onions and peppers:
            In a large skillet on medium heat add 1 tbsp olive oil with 
            sliced onions and peppers. Season with 1/4 teaspoon salt and pepper.
            Cooked until softened and start to caramelize which takes about
            12 - 15 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Cook the steak:
            Heat griddle or large skillet over medium heat. Add the remaining
            olive oil and the sliced steak. Spread the steak evenly and cook 
            for a minute or two then stir to finish cooking. It might need a
            few more minutes but it cooks quickly.
        </li>
        <li>Finishing the cheesesteak:
            Turn the heat to low on the steak and add the peppers and onions.
            Add the provolone slices on top and let the cheese melt.
        </li>
        <li>Assemble the cheesesteak and eat:
            Evenly scoop the cheesesteak and put into the hoagie roll.
            Optionally top it with thyme and its ready to eat.
        </li>
    </ol>
