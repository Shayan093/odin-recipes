        <li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper, plus more to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For the puff pastry</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 sheet puff pastry, thawed in the fridge</li>
        <li>1 large egg yolk</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon cold water</li>
        <li>salt, optional</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Cooking Instructions</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Saute the aromatics and make the roux:
            <p>
            Melt the butter in a dutch oven over medium heat.
                Once butter is melted and sizzling add the onion, celery, and garlic.
                Use the large spoon to stir, saute the vegetables until they're
                translucent, about 3 to 4 minutes.
            </p> 
            <p>
            Reduce the heat to medium and sprinkle the flour over the veggies and 
                fat in the pot. Stir the flour into the vegetables to create a roux, and 
                cook the mixture for 1 minute to remove the raw, floury taste. The roux should
                be pale yellow and leave a thick coating on the vegetables.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>Make the gravy:
            <p>In a small bowl combine chicken stock and milk. Continuously
                stir the roux-coated vegetables while adding the chicken stock-milk
                mixture to the vegetables, 1 cup at a time.
            </p>
            <p>Once all the liquid has been added, simmer the gravy until it thickens,
                about 5-6 minutes. The gravy should go from a thick paste like consistency
                to a smooth gravy that coats the back of your spoon.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>Fold in the chicken and the frozen, thawed vegetables:
            <p>When the gravy has thickened, fold in the chicken, peas, and carrots, 
                as well as the rosemary, thyme, and sage. Stir it all to coat it all in 
                the gravy.
            </p>
            <p>Taste the mixture and, if needed, adjust the seasoning with the salt and pepper.
                Pour the filling into a 9x13-inch baking dish and allow it to cool for 
                15 minutes.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>Roll out the puff pastry dough and egg wash:
            <p>On a lightly floured surface use a rolling pin to roll out the sheet of puff pastry 
                into an 11 x 15-inch rectangle that's 1/8-inch thick. In a small bowl, whisk together 
                the egg yolk and water to make an egg wash.
            </p>
            <p>Lay the rolled sheet of puff pastry on top of the baking dish. Brush the surface of the 
                pastry with the egg wash and fold any excess dough over the top of the dough to create 
                a crust. Crimp the edges as you would pie dough, then brush the fluted edge with more 
                egg wash. Sprinkle a pinch of salt over the surface of the dough, then use a knife to 
                cut small slits in the surface to act as vents.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>Bake the pot pie:
            <p>Place the baking dish on a larger sheet pan to catch any spills in case the filling bubbles 
                over the edge of the dish. Bake the pot pie at 400Â°F for 20-25 minutes or until the top is 
                golden brown and the filling gently bubbles up through the vents.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>Cool slightly, then serve:
            <p>After baking, remove the chicken pot pie from the oven and allow it to cool for 15 minutes 
                prior to serving. The filling will be very hot, so take care when eating.</p>
        </li>
