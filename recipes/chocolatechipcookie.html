    <h1>Chocolate Chip Cookie</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A chocolate chip cookie is a delectable baked good that 
        satisfies the senses with its irresistible aroma, golden-brown 
        color, and mouth-watering taste. This beloved treat typically 
        comprises a delicate balance of butter, sugar, flour, eggs, and 
        vanilla extract, which all blend together to form a heavenly dough. 
        The crowning jewel of this dough, however, is the chocolate chips or chunks, 
        which are generously scattered throughout the mixture to provide pockets of 
        decadent, melty chocolate with every bite. When baked to perfection, these 
        cookies boast a crispy exterior that gives way to a soft, chewy center, making 
        them an ideal choice for any occasion, from a cozy night in to a festive celebration. 
        Whether enjoyed warm from the oven or cooled to room temperature, chocolate chip cookies 
        are a timeless favorite that never fail to delight the taste buds.

    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>
                Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt until well combined.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                In a large bowl, beat together the butter, white sugar, and brown sugar with an electric 
                mixer on medium speed until light and fluffy, for about 2-3 minutes.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Add the eggs, one at a time, and beat well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Gradually mix in the flour mixture, beating on low speed until just combined.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Fold in the chocolate chips until evenly distributed throughout the dough.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Using a cookie scoop or a spoon, drop rounded balls of dough onto a baking sheet lined with 
                parchment paper, spacing them about 2 inches apart.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Bake the cookies in the preheated oven for 10-12 minutes, or until lightly golden brown around the edges.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Remove the cookies from the oven and allow them to cool for a few minutes on the baking sheet before 
                transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
